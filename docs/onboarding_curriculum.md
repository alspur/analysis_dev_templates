# On-Boarding Curriculum

Our work, which is highly analytical, iterative, and collaborative, requires learnign a partiuclar set of tools. The two most important technologies we will rely on are:

- R (for analysis development)
- git (for version control)

We will take advantage of these open-source projects via:

- RStudio (a powerful GUI for R users)
- GitHub (a web service to facilitate collaboration with git)

In order to make the most of these tools, we need to have a strong understanding of the most common uses/workflows while also cultivating advanced knowledge. The following books provide the foundational knowledge for operating effectively on our team:

- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR](http://happygitwithr.com/index.html) by Jenny Bryan

## Getting started with R and GitHub

For new useRs, the following sequence is recommended:

- Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR, Chapters 1-15 - Installation and RStudio setup
- Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR, Chapters 16-22 - Git and RStudio basics
- R for Data Science, Chapters 1-3 - Introduction and Visualization
- R for Data Science, Chapters 4-6 - Basic scripting and data transformation
- R for Data Science, Chapters 7-8 - Exploratory analysis and R projects
- R for Data Science, Chapters 9-16 - Data wrangling
- Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR, Chapters 23-28 - Collaboration
- R for Data Science, Chapters 26-30 - Communicating analysis
- R for Data Science, Chapters 17-21 - Programming with R
- R for Data Science, Chapters 22-25 - Models

## Advanced topics

These books are for intermediate to advanced R programmers, covering functional programming techniques, package development, and text mining.
